A practical, step-by-step notebook demonstrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).  
This repo covers minimal setups (FAISS + OpenAI), LangChain + Chroma real-world usage, and advanced topics like metadata filtering, hybrid search, and evaluation metrics.

---

## Quick summary

- **Lesson 1 — Minimal RAG:** Use SentenceTransformers to embed a small set of docs, build a FAISS index, retrieve top-k, and pass retrieved context to an LLM prompt (OpenAI).
- **Lesson 2 — LangChain + Chroma:** Real-world pipeline with LangChain text splitters, Chroma persistent vector store, and a RetrievalQA chain using a chat model.
- **Lesson 3 — Advanced Chroma:** Metadata, hybrid lexical+semantic retrieval, adding texts with metadata, and measuring recall@k.
